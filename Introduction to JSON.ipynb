    "Programming languages have lots of ways of representing data called \n",
    "*data structures*. Very often you want to flatten, or *serialize* these \n",
    "data structures so that they can be transmitted over the network or stored \n",
    "in a file for later. In the old days, you'd invent a file format of your own \n",
    "devising to do this and write the different bits of your data structure \n",
    "into the file format. But that's an expensive way of doing things and very \n",
    "error prone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern languages have a way of automatically serialising data structures, \n",
    "and the one used by JavaScript took off in a big way, probably because it is \n",
    "very simple to understand and use, and is embedded in every Web browser. \n",
    "Conveniently in your case, it's also very similar to the way things are done \n",
    "natively in Python. This format is called JavaScript Object Notation or [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) for short.\n",

    "You really only need to know about two types of structure to understand JSON. \n",
