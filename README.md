iPython Notebooks for the AERI 2015 [workshop](http://aeri2015.umd.edu/workshop-4/) on Twitter archiving. We will be using them in a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/) environment that has been seeded with Twitter data collected with the [Social Feed Manager](http://github.com/gwu-libraries/social-feed-manager).

The jupyterhub config and a management script to copy these workbooks around
on the server are also here.
